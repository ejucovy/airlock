If you're using Django, see Django Integration for a streamlined setup. Installation \u00b6 pip install airlock-py Basic Usage \u00b6 1. Enqueue side effects \u00b6 Use airlock.enqueue() to express side effects anywhere in your code: import airlock def process_order ( order ): order . status = \"processed\" order . save () airlock . enqueue ( send_confirmation_email , order . id ) airlock . enqueue ( notify_warehouse , order . id ) Side effects don't execute immediately. They're buffered until the surrounding scope decides to dispatch them. 2. Wrap execution in a scope \u00b6 Use airlock.scope() to control when effects escape: import airlock with airlock . scope (): process_order ( order ) # Side effects dispatch here, after the scope exits If an exception occurs inside the scope, side effects are discarded: with airlock . scope (): process_order ( order ) raise ValueError ( \"Something went wrong\" ) # Side effects are NOT dispatched 3. Use the decorator for functions \u00b6 The @airlock.scoped() decorator wraps an entire function: @airlock . scoped () def handle_checkout ( order ): process_order ( order ) update_inventory ( order ) # Side effects dispatch after function returns successfully Configuring Defaults \u00b6 Instead of passing arguments to every scope() call, configure defaults once at startup: import airlock from airlock.integrations.executors.celery import celery_executor # Set once at app startup airlock . configure ( executor = celery_executor , ) # Now all scopes use Celery by default with airlock . scope (): airlock . enqueue ( my_task ) # Will dispatch via Celery Available executors \u00b6 Airlock provides built-in executors for common task backends: from airlock.integrations.executors.sync import sync_executor # Direct function call from airlock.integrations.executors.celery import celery_executor # Celery .delay() from airlock.integrations.executors.django_q import django_q_executor from airlock.integrations.executors.huey import huey_executor from airlock.integrations.executors.dramatiq import dramatiq_executor The default executor is sync_executor , which calls functions directly. Controlling What Executes: Policies \u00b6 Policies let you filter, observe, or block side effects. Drop all effects (dry-run mode) \u00b6 with airlock . scope ( policy = airlock . DropAll ()): process_order ( order ) # Nothing dispatched - useful for dry-runs or migrations Block specific tasks \u00b6 with airlock . scope ( policy = airlock . BlockTasks ({ \"send_confirmation_email\" })): process_order ( order ) # Warehouse notified, but no confirmation email sent Assert no effects (for testing) \u00b6 with airlock . scope ( policy = airlock . AssertNoEffects ()): calculate_total ( order ) # Raises if any enqueue() is called Inspect buffered intents \u00b6 with airlock . scope ( policy = airlock . DropAll ()) as scope : process_order ( order ) # Inspect what would have been dispatched for intent in scope . intents : print ( f \"Task: { intent . name } , Args: { intent . args } \" ) Putting It Together \u00b6 Here's a complete example showing configuration and usage: # app.py import airlock from airlock.integrations.executors.celery import celery_executor # Configure at startup airlock . configure ( executor = celery_executor ) # tasks.py from celery import shared_task @shared_task def send_confirmation_email ( order_id ): ... @shared_task def notify_warehouse ( order_id ): ... # models.py import airlock from . import tasks class Order : def process ( self ): self . status = \"processed\" self . save () airlock . enqueue ( tasks . send_confirmation_email , self . id ) airlock . enqueue ( tasks . notify_warehouse , self . id ) # services.py import airlock @airlock . scoped () def checkout ( user , cart ): order = Order . create ( user , cart ) order . process () return order # Celery tasks dispatch after checkout() returns Next Steps \u00b6 Core Model - Understand the 3 concerns (Scope, Policy, Executor) Testing Guide - Test code that uses airlock Django Integration - Automatic request-scoped side effects Custom Policies - Write your own filtering logic Custom Executors - Integrate with other task backends","title":"Getting Started"},{"location":"getting-started/#getting-started","text":"This guide covers airlock basics without framework-specific setup.

Functions \u00b6 scope \u00b6 scope ( policy : Policy | None = None , * , _cls : type [ Scope ] | None = None , ** kwargs ) -> Iterator [ Scope ] Context manager defining a lifecycle boundary for side effects. Parameters: policy ( Policy | None , default: None ) \u2013 Policy controlling what intents are allowed. Defaults to configured policy or AllowAll if not configured. _cls ( type [ Scope ] | None , default: None ) \u2013 Scope class to use. Defaults to configured scope_cls or Scope if not configured. Subclass Scope and override should_flush() to customize flush/discard behavior. **kwargs \u2013 Additional arguments passed to Scope constructor (e.g., executor). executor \u2013 Callable that executes intents. Defaults to configured executor or synchronous execution if not configured. See airlock.integrations.executors for available executors. Behavior On normal exit: calls flush() if should_flush(None) returns True On exception: calls flush() if should_flush(error) returns True , else discard() The default Scope.should_flush() returns True on success, False on error. Subclass Scope to customize this behavior. Note Arguments passed explicitly always override configured defaults. Use airlock.configure() to set application-wide defaults.

This is the ONLY function domain code should call. Parameters: task ( Callable ) \u2013 The callable to execute (Celery task, function, etc.). *args ( Any , default: () ) \u2013 Positional arguments for the task. _origin ( str | None , default: None ) \u2013 Optional origin metadata for debugging/observability. This is NOT auto-detected - it must be set explicitly if needed. Integrations (Django middleware, Celery task wrapper) may set this to provide context like request path, task name, or trace/span IDs. For structured observability, prefer OpenTelemetry span context. _dispatch_options ( dict [ str , Any ] | None , default: None ) \u2013 Optional dispatch options (countdown, queue, etc.). Passed through to the task queue backend (e.g., Celery's apply_async ). Ignored for plain callables. **kwargs ( Any , default: {} ) \u2013 Keyword arguments for the task. Raises: PolicyEnqueueError \u2013 If called from within a policy callback. NoScopeError \u2013 If no scope is active. PolicyViolation \u2013 If a policy explicitly rejects the intent via on_enqueue() . For example, AssertNoEffects policy raises PolicyViolation on any enqueue. When this happens, the intent is NOT added to the buffer. policy \u00b6 policy ( p : Policy ) -> Iterator [ None ] Context manager for local policy contexts. Intents enqueued within this context capture the policy and apply it at flush time. This enables local control without nested buffers. Example:: with airlock.scope(): airlock.enqueue(task_a) # will dispatch with airlock.policy(DropAll()): airlock.enqueue(task_b) # will NOT dispatch airlock.enqueue(task_c) # will dispatch Unlike nested scopes, all intents go to the same buffer. The local policy is metadata that affects dispatch decisions at flush. Note This does NOT create a new buffer or nested scope. All intents from within this context still go to the enclosing scope's buffer. The policy is captured on each intent at enqueue time and evaluated at flush. This is intentional - it preserves a single dispatch boundary while allowing fine-grained control over which intents survive. get_current_scope \u00b6 get_current_scope () -> Scope | None Get the currently active airlock scope, if any. Classes \u00b6 Scope \u00b6 A lifecycle scope that buffers and controls side effect intents. Parameters: policy ( Policy ) \u2013 Policy controlling what intents are allowed. executor ( Executor | None , default: None ) \u2013 Callable that executes intents. Defaults to synchronous execution. See airlock.integrations.executors for available executors. intents property \u00b6 intents : list [ Intent ] Read-only access to buffered intents for inspection. own_intents property \u00b6 own_intents : list [ Intent ] Intents enqueued directly in this scope (not captured from nested scopes). captured_intents property \u00b6 captured_intents : list [ Intent ] Intents captured from nested scopes. is_flushed property \u00b6 is_flushed : bool is_discarded property \u00b6 is_discarded : bool is_active property \u00b6 is_active : bool True if this scope is currently the active scope. enter \u00b6 enter () -> Scope Activate this scope. Sets the context var so enqueue() routes intents to this scope. Must call exit() when done, before calling flush() or discard() . Returns: Scope \u2013 Self for chaining. Raises: ScopeStateError \u2013 If this scope is already active. exit \u00b6 exit () -> None Deactivate this scope. Resets the context var to the previous scope (or None ). Must be called before flush() or discard() . Raises: ScopeStateError \u2013 If this scope is not active. flush \u00b6 flush () -> list [ Intent ] Flush all buffered intents - apply policy and dispatch. Filters intents through policies (both local and scope-level), then dispatches them in FIFO order using the configured executor. Returns: list [ Intent ] \u2013 List of intents that were dispatched (after policy filtering). Raises: ScopeStateError \u2013 If scope is already flushed, discarded, or still active. Exception \u2013 Any exception raised by the executor during dispatch (fail-fast behavior). See _dispatch_all() docstring for details on exception handling. Note The scope is marked as flushed even if an executor raises an exception. This prevents retry attempts, as the scope is in an inconsistent state (some intents may have been dispatched before the failure). discard \u00b6 discard () -> list [ Intent ] Discard all buffered intents without dispatching. should_flush \u00b6 should_flush ( error : BaseException | None ) -> bool Decide terminal action when context manager exits. Override this method in subclasses to customize flush/discard behavior. Parameters: error ( BaseException | None ) \u2013 The exception that caused exit, or None for normal exit. Returns: bool \u2013 True to flush (dispatch intents), False to discard. Default behavior: flush on success, discard on error. before_descendant_flushes \u00b6 before_descendant_flushes ( exiting_scope : Scope , intents : list [ Intent ]) -> list [ Intent ] Called when a nested scope exits and attempts to flush. This method is called during the parent chain walk, allowing each ancestor to decide which intents the exiting scope may flush vs which to capture. Parameters: exiting_scope ( Scope ) \u2013 The nested scope that is exiting (may be deeply nested). intents ( list [ Intent ] ) \u2013 The list of intents the exiting scope wants to flush. Returns: list [ Intent ] \u2013 list[Intent]: The list of intents to allow through (the exiting scope will flush these). Any intents not in the returned list are captured into this scope's buffer. Important : Must return a list; returning None or other types raises TypeError . Raises: TypeError \u2013 If return value is not a list. Any other exception raised by this method will propagate and abort the flush, potentially leaving the scope in a partially-modified state. Default behavior: Capture all intents (return [] ). This is the controlled default - outer scopes have authority over nested scopes. Override this method to allow nested scopes to flush independently: Return [] to capture all intents (default, controlled) Return intents to allow all (independent nested scopes) Return filtered list to selectively capture Note Do not mutate the intents list. Return a new list or slice. Returning intents not in the input list has undefined behavior. In multi-level nesting, exiting_scope is always the innermost scope, not necessarily the immediate child. Intermediate scopes haven't exited yet. Example:: class IndependentScope(Scope): def before_descendant_flushes(self, exiting_scope, intents): return intents # Allow nested scopes to flush independently class SmartScope(Scope): def before_descendant_flushes(self, exiting_scope, intents): # Capture dangerous tasks, allow safe ones return [i for i in intents if 'dangerous' not in i.name] Intent dataclass \u00b6 Represents the intent to perform a side effect.

Returns: bool \u2013 True if all local policies allow this intent. Note This does NOT guarantee the intent will be dispatched. It does not consider: Scope-level policy (checked separately at flush) Whether the scope flushes or discards Dispatch execution success Use for inspection and audit, not execution prediction. Protocols \u00b6 Policy \u00b6 Bases: Protocol Protocol for side effect policies. Policies are per-intent boolean gates that decide which intents dispatch. This design enforces FIFO order by construction - policies can filter intents but cannot reorder them. Methods: Name Description on_enqueue Called when an intent is added to the buffer. Use for observation, logging, or raising PolicyViolation for hard blocks. allows Called at flush time for each intent. Return True to dispatch, False to silently drop. on_enqueue \u00b6 on_enqueue ( intent : Intent ) -> None Called when an intent is added to the buffer. Observe or raise PolicyViolation . allows \u00b6 allows ( intent : Intent ) -> bool Called at flush time. Return True to dispatch, False to drop. Executor \u00b6 Bases: Protocol Protocol for intent executors. An executor is a callable that takes an Intent and executes it via some dispatch mechanism (synchronous, Celery, django-q, etc.). Built-in executors are available in airlock.integrations.executors : sync_executor : Synchronous execution (default) celery_executor : Dispatch via Celery .delay() / .apply_async() django_q_executor : Dispatch via django-q's async_task() django_tasks_executor : Dispatch via Django 6+'s built-in tasks framework huey_executor : Dispatch via Huey's .schedule() dramatiq_executor : Dispatch via Dramatiq's .send() Custom executors can be written by implementing this protocol. __call__ \u00b6 __call__ ( intent : Intent ) -> None Execute the given intent. Built-in Policies \u00b6 AllowAll \u00b6 Policy that allows all side effects. DropAll \u00b6 Policy that drops all side effects. AssertNoEffects \u00b6 Policy that raises if any side effect is attempted. BlockTasks \u00b6 Policy that blocks specific tasks by name. LogOnFlush \u00b6 Policy that logs intents at flush time (allows all). CompositePolicy \u00b6 Policy that combines multiple policies (all must allow). Exceptions \u00b6 AirlockError \u00b6 Bases: Exception Base exception for all airlock errors. UsageError \u00b6 Bases: AirlockError Raised when airlock is used incorrectly (API misuse). NoScopeError \u00b6 Bases: UsageError Raised when enqueue() is called with no active scope. This is intentional: airlock requires explicit lifecycle boundaries. Side effects should not escape silently. Every enqueue() must occur within a scope() that decides when (and whether) effects dispatch. If you're seeing this error, wrap your code in an airlock.scope() :: with airlock.scope(): do_stuff() # enqueue() calls are now valid PolicyEnqueueError \u00b6 Bases: UsageError Raised when enqueue() is called from within a policy callback.

Installation \u00b6 pip install airlock-py celery Enqueueing Celery tasks \u00b6 To enqueue and dispatch Celery tasks through airlock, use the celery_executor . When you pass this executor to a scope, any calls to airlock.enqueue() will dispatch via Celery's .apply_async() method when the scope exits. from airlock.integrations.executors.celery import celery_executor with airlock . scope ( executor = celery_executor ): airlock . enqueue ( send_email , user_id = 123 ) airlock . enqueue ( process_data , item_id = 456 ) # Both tasks dispatch via .apply_async() when scope exits Celery options \u00b6 You can pass Celery-specific options like countdown , queue , and priority via the _dispatch_options parameter: airlock . enqueue ( send_email , user_id = 123 , _dispatch_options = { \"countdown\" : 60 , # Delay 60 seconds \"queue\" : \"emails\" , # Use specific queue \"priority\" : 9 , # High priority } ) These options are passed through to Celery's .apply_async() method.

Out of the box, Airlock is compatible with many popular task frameworks including Celery, django-q, Dramatiq, huey, and Django Tasks. How it works \u00b6 The middleware automatically wraps each request in a scope with the following behaviors: All side effects enqueued during a request remain buffered until the end of the request. When the Response reaches airlock's middleware: If the response is an error (4xx/5xx or unhandled exception) side effects are discarded. If the response is successful (1xx/2xx/3xx) side effects are dispatched. If you're in a database transaction, side effects will be deferred until after the transaction has committed automatically. ( What's DjangoScope ? ) These default behaviors are configurable . Installation & setup \u00b6 pip install airlock-py In settings.py , add to INSTALLED_APPS , add middleware, and configure your task framework: INSTALLED_APPS = [ ... \"airlock.integrations.django\" , # Auto-configures airlock ] MIDDLEWARE = [ ... \"airlock.integrations.django.AirlockMiddleware\" , ] AIRLOCK = { \"EXECUTOR\" : \"airlock.integrations.executors.celery.celery_executor\" , } Adding \"airlock.integrations.django\" to INSTALLED_APPS auto-configures airlock. This means Celery tasks, management commands, and any other code can use plain with airlock.scope() or @airlock.scoped() without needing to explicitly pass _cls=DjangoScope . What's DjangoScope ? \u00b6 DjangoScope is a thin layer on top of airlock.Scope which hooks into transaction.on_commit for dispatching intents. This ensures that if a scope exits within a transaction -- or in view code with ATOMIC_REQUESTS=True -- the resulting side effects will still only run after database state has settled. Basic usage \u00b6 Anywhere in your models/views/services/etc, pass your task functions to airlock.enqueue() : ## models.py import airlock import .tasks class Order ( models . Model ): def process ( self ): self . status = \"processed\" self . save () airlock . enqueue ( tasks . send_confirmation_email , order_id = self . id ) airlock . enqueue ( tasks . notify_warehouse , order_id = self . id ) ## views.py def checkout ( request ): order = Order . objects . get ( id = request . POST [ 'order_id' ]) order . process () return HttpResponse ( \"OK\" ) # All side effects dispatch here after response + transaction commit Configuration \u00b6 With zero configuration, all tasks execute synchronously as plain callables at dispatch time, hooked in to transaction.on_commit(robust=True) against the default database. # settings.py AIRLOCK = { # Just call functions synchronously at dispatch time \"EXECUTOR\" : \"airlock.integrations.executors.sync.sync_executor\" , # Other built in options: # \"EXECUTOR\": \"airlock.integrations.executors.celery.celery_executor\", # \"EXECUTOR\": \"airlock.integrations.executors.django_q.django_q_executor\", # \"EXECUTOR\": \"airlock.integrations.executors.huey.huey_executor\", # \"EXECUTOR\": \"airlock.integrations.executors.dramatiq.dramatiq_executor\", # \"EXECUTOR\": \"airlock.integrations.executors.django_tasks.django_tasks_executor\", \"POLICY\" : \"airlock.AllowAll\" , } Overriding 4xx/5xx behavior \u00b6 By default airlock's Django middleware discards side effects on 4xx/5xx responses and on exceptions. To customize this behavior, subclass AirlockMiddleware and override should_flush : ## middleware.py from airlock.integrations.django import AirlockMiddleware class UnconditionallyDispatchingAirlockMiddleware ( AirlockMiddleware ): def should_flush ( self , request , response ): return True ## settings.py MIDDLEWARE = [ # ... \"my_app.middleware.UnconditionallyDispatchingAirlockMiddleware\" , # ... ] Middleware placement \u00b6 Any placement works for most projects. Django's request handler converts uncaught exceptions to 4xx/5xx responses, so AirlockMiddleware typically sees the correct status code and discards appropriately. Placement matters if you have custom middleware with process_exception() that catches view exceptions and returns 2xx or 3xx responses. In that case, place AirlockMiddleware higher (earlier) in the list than such middleware, so it sees the exception via its own process_exception before another middleware converts it to a misleading success response. If you care about dispatching conditional on exceptions from middleware themselves (not just views), place AirlockMiddleware above those middleware. Similarly, if you use ATOMIC_REQUESTS=False and maintain your own control over transaction boundaries across middleware layers, you may need to be more opinionated about ordering. Airlock in management commands \u00b6 Wrap commands with @airlock.scoped() for automatic scoping: All side effects enqueued during a command remain buffered until the end of the command. When the command finishes: If there was an unhandled exception, side effects are discarded. If the command is successful, side effects are dispatched. from django.core.management.base import BaseCommand import airlock class Command ( BaseCommand ): @airlock . scoped () def handle ( self , * args , ** options ): for order in Order . objects . filter ( status = 'pending' ): order . process () # Side effects dispatch after handle() completes For dry-run support, use a policy: class Command ( BaseCommand ): def add_arguments ( self , parser ): parser . add_argument ( '--dry-run' , action = 'store_true' ) def handle ( self , * args , ** options ): policy = airlock . DropAll () if options [ 'dry_run' ] else airlock . AllowAll () with airlock . scope ( policy = policy ): for order in Order . objects . filter ( status = 'pending' ): order . process () Manual scoping \u00b6 You can always maintain explicit control with the context manager API or decorator. After adding \"airlock.integrations.django\" to INSTALLED_APPS , all scopes automatically use DjangoScope with transaction-aware dispatch: import airlock # In a Celery task, script, etc: @airlock . scoped () def background_job (): do_stuff () # Effects dispatch after transaction commit # Or using the context manager: def background_job (): with airlock . scope (): do_stuff () # Effects dispatch after transaction commit # In a view with finer-grained control: def checkout ( request ): order = Order . objects . get ( id = request . POST [ 'order_id' ]) with airlock . scope (): order . process () with airlock . scope (): ping_analytics ( request . user ) return HttpResponse ( \"OK\" ) This pattern can also be combined with middleware-based implicit scopes. You'll want to read more about how nested scopes work in that case! Celery tasks \u00b6 With the INSTALLED_APPS configuration, Celery tasks can use @airlock.scoped() directly: from celery import shared_task import airlock @shared_task @airlock . scoped () def process_order ( order_id ): order = Order . objects . get ( id = order_id ) order . process () # Side effects dispatch after task completes successfully # and any database transaction commits","title":"Overview"},{"location":"django/#django-integration","text":"Airlock provides a Django middleware that automatically creates a scope for your view code.

Concern Controlled By Question WHEN Scope When do effects escape? WHAT Policy Which effects execute? HOW Executor How do they run? Concern 1: WHEN (Scope) \u00b6 Scopes control timing and lifecycle. # Basic scope: flush on success, discard on error with airlock . scope (): do_stuff () # Effects buffered... # Effects execute here (on normal exit) # Transaction-aware scope: wait for commit from airlock.integrations.django import DjangoScope with transaction . atomic (): with airlock . scope ( _cls = DjangoScope ): order . save () airlock . enqueue ( send_email , order . id ) # Effects still buffered... # Effects execute here (after commit) Scope decides: \u00b6 When to flush (end of block, after commit, custom) Whether to flush (success vs error) How to store buffer (memory, database, etc.) Default: flush on normal exit, discard on exception. Concern 2: WHAT (Policy) \u00b6 Policies filter and observe intents. # Drop all effects (dry-run) with airlock . scope ( policy = airlock . DropAll ()): process_orders () # Effects buffered but never dispatched # Assert no effects (testing) with airlock . scope ( policy = airlock .

Concern 3: HOW (Executor) \u00b6 Executors control dispatch mechanism. # Sync execution (default) with airlock . scope (): airlock . enqueue ( my_function , arg = 123 ) # Executes: my_function(arg=123) # Celery from airlock.integrations.executors.celery import celery_executor with airlock . scope ( executor = celery_executor ): airlock . enqueue ( celery_task , arg = 123 ) # Executes: celery_task.delay(arg=123) # django-q from airlock.integrations.executors.django_q import django_q_executor with airlock . scope ( executor = django_q_executor ): airlock . enqueue ( any_function , arg = 123 ) # Executes: async_task(any_function, arg=123) Executor decides: \u00b6 How to run the task (sync, queue, thread pool...)

This keeps the system predictable: the set of intents comes from your domain code, not from policy logic. 2.
